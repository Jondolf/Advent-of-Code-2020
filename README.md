# Advent of Code 2020

Here you can find my solutions for the [Advent of Code 2020](https://adventofcode.com/2020).

I wrote all of my solutions in [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/). My main goal was to just complete as many puzzles as I can in a fairly clean way.

## File structure

[/inputs](./inputs) has all of my inputs as _.txt_ files\
[/solutions](./solutions) has all of my solutions as _.ts_ files\
[/helpers](./helpers) has helper functions as _.ts_ files

## Running code

The solutions can be run with `ts-node solutions/dayX.ts`, if ts-node is installed globally. Alternatively, you can install ts-node locally with `npm install` and run the solutions with `npx ts-node solutions/dayX.ts`.

`npm run start` can be used to run all solutions at once.
